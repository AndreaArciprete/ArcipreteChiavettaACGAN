# ArcipreteChiavettaACGAN
In this directory there are four Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Networks.
The directory called ACGAN_MNIST_1 contains one kind of ACGAN trained on MNIST dataset and also several images showing how the model improves its performances during the training phase.
The directory called ACGAN_MNIST_2 contains another kind of ACGAN trained on MNIST dataset and also several images showing how the model improves its performances during the training phase.
The directory called ACGAN_CIFAR10_1 contains one kind of ACGAN trained on CIFAR10 dataset and also several images showing how the model improves its performances during the training phase.
The directory called ACGAN_CIFAR10_2 contains another kind of ACGAN trained on CIFAR10 dataset and also several images showing how the model improves its performances during the training phase.
In order to run the code you can simply use Colab and run each file whose extension is .ipynb
